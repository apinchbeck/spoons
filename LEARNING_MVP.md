## What is Spoons App?

Spoons App is based on the **spoon theory**, a metaphor for energy management. Everyone has a limited amount of energy (“spoons”) each day. The app helps you:

- Track how many spoons you have each day  
- Plan tasks and activities according to your energy  
- Reflect on how much energy tasks actually cost  
- Learn your personal patterns to manage your mental health and daily balance

## Getting Started

1. **Sign Up / Log In:** Create an account or log in to save your data.  
2. **Daily Spoon Prompt:** On your first login each day, the app will ask:  

   *“How many spoons do you have today?”*  

   Enter your energy for the day — this lets you recognize that your energy fluctuates daily.  
3. **Set Your Preferences:** In **Settings**, you can:  
   - Set your default daily spoon budget  
   - Choose light or dark mode  
   - Adjust accessibility options (fonts, contrast, etc.)

## Tasks and Timing

1. **Add Tasks:** Enter tasks you want to complete today or in the future.  
2. **Assign Spoon Costs:** Estimate how much energy each task will take.  
3. **Choose Timing Tags:** Label tasks as:  
   - **Today** – must be done today  
   - **Soon** – coming up, but not urgent  
   - **Later** – for future planning  
   - **Someday** – optional or low priority

## Task Reflection

After completing a task, you can **rate how much energy it actually cost you**. This helps you:  

- Compare estimated vs actual energy spent  
- Learn about your daily energy patterns  
- Improve planning and self-awareness  

---

## Reflection Exercises

- The app provides **prompts at the end of the day or after tasks** to reflect on your energy usage.  
- Reflection questions may include:  
  - “Which tasks used more energy than expected?”  
  - “Did you save energy for important activities?”  
  - “What could help manage your spoons better tomorrow?”

## Accessibility & Personalization

- Adjust **fonts, contrast, and themes** for readability.  
- Configure your **default daily spoon budget** for your personal energy baseline.  
- The app is designed to be **inclusive and easy to use** for a variety of cognitive and physical needs.
