# Spoons

Spoons is a personal productivity and mental energy management app designed for neurodivergent and energy-conscious individuals. The app helps users organize tasks and 
activities based on their available mental, emotional, and physical energy, rather than arbitrary deadlines or productivity expectations.

The project is intended to explore thoughtful approaches to task management and self-care, focusing on energy, honesty, and sustainable habits.

## Motivation

Most productivity tools assume a baseline level of focus, energy, and mental bandwidth that not everyone has. Spoons acknowledges the reality of fluctuating energy 
levels, burnout, and mental health challenges, offering an approach that adapts to the user, rather than asking the user to adapt to the system.
