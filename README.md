# Spoons App

**Note:** This README documents the Spoons App repository for developers and contributors.  

**Learning MVP Guide:**  
https://github.com/apinchbeck/spoons/blob/main/LEARNING_MVP.md

**Spoons App helps you understand and manage your daily energy using the spoon theory.** Track your spoons, plan tasks with timing priorities, and reflect on your 
energy usage to build self-awareness and balance.

---

Spoons App is a simple, intuitive tool designed to help users track and manage their daily energy and mental health resources using the "spoon theory" metaphor. The 
Learning MVP helps users build self-awareness about their energy usage through task tracking, timing priorities, reflection exercises, and personalization settings.

---

## Features

- **Daily Spoon Tracking:** When users sign in for the first time each day, they are prompted to log how many spoons they have that day, recognizing that energy 
fluctuates day-to-day. They can then track how many spoons are spent on tasks and activities.  
- **Task Management:** Add tasks, assign spoon costs, and tag each task with one of four timing categories: "Today," "Soon," "Later," or "Someday."  
- **Task Reflection:** After completing a task, users can rate how much energy it actually cost them. This supports reflection exercises and helps users learn about 
their energy usage patterns.  
- **Reflection Exercises:** Structured prompts guide users to reflect on their energy patterns, task completion, and self-care habits.  
- **Settings & Personalization:** Configure your default daily spoon budget, theme preferences, and accessibility options.  
- **User Authentication:** Create an account and log in to save your data securely.  
- **Accessibility:** Designed to be inclusive and easy to use for a variety of cognitive and physical needs.
